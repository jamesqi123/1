# I found a dataset from Kaggle, and I will conduct a business intelligence analysis on a company's customer data. This dataset is likely a customer record from a telecom company, with personally identifiable information removed. The data includes customer information such as demographics, telecom services used, billing details, etc. I will perform business intelligence analysis in Tableau.

The research questions they are investigating revolve around customer behavior, service preferences, pricing strategies, and churn analysis. Here are some key questions:

1. Customer Demographics & Distribution
What is the gender and age distribution of the company's customers?
Do customers with partners tend to have dependents as well?
How does the customer base vary in terms of demographic characteristics?
2. Service Subscription Patterns
What percentage of customers subscribe to phone service, internet service, or both?
Among internet service types, which is the most popular (DSL, Fiber Optic, None)?
How many customers use multiple phone lines vs. single phone lines?
Do certain demographic groups tend to choose specific service types?
3. Billing and Payment Preferences
Which payment methods (Credit Card, Bank Transfer, Electronic Check, Mailed Check) are most commonly used?
How does the preference for payment methods differ between customers who use paperless billing and those who do not?
Does contract length (Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year) impact payment method preferences?
4. Pricing and Customer Tenure
How does Monthly Charge change as customers stay longer (Tenure)?
Are there pricing differences between different demographic groups (e.g., men vs. women, seniors vs. non-seniors)?
Does the company offer initial discounts (e.g., lower prices for new customers)?
Do pricing patterns differ by service type (e.g., multiple lines vs. single line, different internet services)?
5. Churn Analysis (Customer Retention)
What percentage of customers churn (cancel their service)?
Are churn rates higher for specific service types (e.g., fiber optic vs. DSL)?
Do demographic factors (age, gender, partner/dependent status) influence churn?
Are certain payment methods associated with higher churn rates?
Are customers who pay higher monthly charges more likely to churn?
6. Correlation Between Pricing, Services, and Churn
Do customers who pay more tend to leave more often?
Are high-churn groups subscribing to higher-cost services?
Do seniors or younger customers pay more for the same services?
How do tenure and churn relateâ€”do new customers leave more often than long-term ones?
7. Business Strategies and Insights
Should the company adjust its pricing strategy to retain certain customer segments?
Are introductory promotions (e.g., cheaper prices for men in the first 3 months) effective?
Is fiber optic pricing a major reason for customer churn?
Should the company target specific demographic groups differently to reduce churn?
8. Further Investigations
Can the company predict which customers are at high risk of churning?
What retention strategies could be implemented based on these insights?
What additional data (customer support interactions, complaints, customer satisfaction) could help refine these findings?
